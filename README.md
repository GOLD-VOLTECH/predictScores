How to Use the General Prediction Function

    Modify the Inputs: Change the team1, team2, lambdaTeam1, and lambdaTeam2 variables to represent the teams and their expected goals.

    Run the Code: Execute the script to see the predicted scorelines and their probabilities.

This generalized function allows you to input different teams and their expected goals to predict the most likely scorelines for any match.
